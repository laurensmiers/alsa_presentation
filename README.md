# ALSA presentation

A presentation about ALSA I gave at one point.

Presentation was made using the reveal.js framework (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
It uses the markdown plugin to convert alsa_info.md to something presentable.

DISCLAIMER:
This was my knowledge of ALSA at one point in time and space.
I do not claim that any of the info in this presentation is correct.
But it worked at one point ;).
